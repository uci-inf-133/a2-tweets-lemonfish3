10/10
- 3/3 Summarizing tweets
- 4/4 Identifying the most popular activities
- 3/3 Adding a text earch interface

2. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

I spent more than 7 hours on this assignments.

3. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list sites like StackOverflow or specific URLs for tutorials; describe queries to Generative AI or use of AI-based code completion)

I looked up for functions that manipulates arrays in javascripts and got most of the useful information from W3School and Google search result.
I also used ChatGPT for the graph part in activities.js. Prompts I asked are mostly about the graph and error message I encoutered when I test my graph.

4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

No, I did not ask classmates or other individuals for this assignment.

5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

For part3, my data is slightly different than the demo in the instruction. I only filtered completed events for activityType, as instructed in part 2: Note that these values only have to be identified for completed tweets, which follow a fairly rigid format. Syntax for regular expressions is beyond the scope of this class, but may be helpful for calculating these values. indexOf or search should also be sufficient.
